<p>The Lexer reads in an input and converts each word, number and symbol into a token.</p>
<p>Tokens are used to identify common types or symbols that would exist in any
programming language and makes it easier for the machine to turn our input into the language we're turning it into.</p>

<p>The parser makes sure that the input follows tran and is accurate to the language definition.</p>
